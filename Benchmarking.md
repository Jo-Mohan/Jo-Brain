Benchmarking is the process of comparing a trading strategy's performance against a benchmark to assess its relative returns, risk, and efficiency. It tells you if a strategy actually added value or just tracked how the market moved.

An example would be benchmarking how your strategy for the asset class of equities performed against the S&P 500.

We can track excess returns of the strategy $R_{excess}$ as:

$$R_{excess} = R_{portfolio} - R_{benchmark}$$
