Given a set $A$ and an equivalence relation $R$ on $A$, the **equivalence class** of an element $a \in A$ is the subset:  
$$  
[a] = { x \in A \mid (a, x) \in R }  
$$ 
This is the set of all elements that are related to $a$ under $R$.

## Properties

- Every element of $A$ belongs to **exactly one** equivalence class.
    
- The equivalence classes **partition** the set $A$:
    
    1. They are **disjoint** (no overlap).
        
    2. Their **union** equals the entire set $A$.
        
- If $aRb$, then $[a] = [b]$.
    
- If $a \not\sim b$, then $[a] \cap [b] = \emptyset$.

## Intuitive Meaning

Equivalence classes group together all elements that are considered _"the same"_ under a given rule of equivalence.
