For any integers $r, s$, there exists a minimum number $R(r,s)$ such that every graph with at least $R(r,s)$ vertices contains:

- a **clique** of size (r), or
    
- an **independent set** of size (s).
    
- $R(3,3) = 6$: in any group of 6 people, either 3 all know each other or 3 are mutual strangers.


No matter how edges are colored (two colors = friendship/enmity), large enough systems force a monochromatic substructure.


For any integers $k, c$, there exists $n$ such that any coloring of the k-element subsets of an (n)-element set with $c$ colors contains a monochromatic subset of size $m > k$.
