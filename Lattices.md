A **lattice** is a poset where any two elements have both a **greatest lower bound** (meet) and a **least upper bound** (join).

---

## Definition

For a poset $(P, \le)$:

- The **meet** of $(x, y): x \wedge y = \text{greatest element } \le x, y$.
    
- The **join** of $(x, y): x \vee y = \text{least element } \ge x, y$.
    

If both exist for all pairs, (P) is a **lattice**.

## Examples

- **Divisibility:** meet = gcd, join = lcm.
    
- **Subsets:** meet = intersection, join = union.
